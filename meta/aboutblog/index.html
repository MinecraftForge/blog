You can even tell it to host the pages under your own domain name.</p><p>This, combined with a Static Site Generator (a tool that can create said static web data from simple markdown files) and Github Actions (a tool that can automatically run other tools when the github code is updated), we were able to set up a blog that is hosted and managed for us with no hosting costs, no upkeep, and no pain.</p><p>This unlocked a world of possibilities.</p><h2 id=publishing>Publishing</h2><p>Since this blog is generated with Hugo, a static site generator, there is only one reliable way to tell when new posts are made.</p><p>RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is an xml file that other tools can look at to determine whether the content of a site has updated.</p><p>It is typically used with a Reader that can combine the content of multiple websites into an easy to read feed.</p><p>However, in this case, we use it to send out two webhooks; one to Discord (to replace the manual system of writing content in the Announcements channel) and one to Twitter (to be able to publish our posts to a much much wider audience).</p><p>We decided to do this after a conversation with some modders, when it was determined that despite the work that has gone into updating the community with regular announcements, it still wasn&rsquo;t reaching a wide enough audience for its intended purpose to work.</p><p>By consolidating all of the FUN announcements into one place, and automatically posting them to Discord (to keep the current system in place) and Twiter, we essentially triple the visibility of our posts, which can only increase over time as people retweet / share / subscribe to announcement channels.</p><p>We hope that eventually, this will be able to keep everyone that uses Forge updated on everything we do via FUN.</p><h2 id=personal-posts>Personal Posts</h2><p>Of course, this is a Blog, not an announcement feed.</p><p>The announcements are simply the secondary reason we have it.</p><p>The main reason is to share the aforementioned debugging tales, deep dives into obscure tools, and the intricate and interesting history of some of the tools we&rsquo;ve created over the years.</p><p>We deeply believe that this blog will be of interest to a lot of community members.<br>Doubly so, since we&rsquo;re going to allow community members to, should they desire, write articles for the blog too.</p><p>Simply get in touch with one of us (preferably Curle or cpw) and we&rsquo;ll get you sorted.</p><h2 id=summing-it-up>Summing it up</h2><p>This Blog will be dual purposed. We&rsquo;ll post regular updates on changes to the API (in a weekly-roundup manner) so that modders and users can keep up to date on new features and things that may affect them.</p><p>We&rsquo;ll also post personal tales and stories, in-depth explanations of sections of the API and the toolchain, and generally things that interest us and we think will interest you.</p><p>The blog has categories for each of these types of posts, so that you can filter things out and see what you want to see.</p><p>Each post will be published to Discord (taking the purpose of the current Announcements channel usage) and to Twitter.</p></div></article></main><div class="authorbox clearfix"><figure class=authorbox__avatar><img alt="curle avatar" src=/img/authors/curle.png class=avatar height=90 width=90></figure><div class=authorbox__header><span class=authorbox__name>About curle</span></div><div class=authorbox__description>Curle is the current project coordinator; they manage the Triage team that ensures the quality

We discuss the nature of obfuscated names and the problems they cause, and introduce the concepts of intermediate mappings and human-readable mappings and how they fix the problems of obfuscated mappings. We also briefly discuss how mappings are present in the development and production environments of Minecraft, and interspersed throughout the post are examples of the various mappings in play throughout the Minecraft modding community, including Mojmaps.</description></item><item><author>curle</author><title>Forgejam 2022</title><link>https://blog.minecraftforge.net/announcements/forgejam22/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jul 2022 20:46:42 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.minecraftforge.net/announcements/forgejam22/</guid><summary>The Forge Jam will run from 1st July to 31st July, with judging on the 1st August.

What can it do, what can&amp;rsquo;t it do, why do we recommend it. Finally, I&amp;rsquo;ll try and put together some resources for getting started.
What is JAR signing? Jar signing is the act of generating a cryptographic signature for each member of a jar file.</summary><description/></item><item><author>curle</author><title>About the Blog</title><link>https://blog.minecraftforge.net/meta/aboutblog/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.minecraftforge.net/meta/aboutblog/</guid><summary>About this Blog</summary><description>Forge now has an official Blog!

Lots of breaking changes, beware!</summary><description>1.19.3 is out. Mojang did huge refactors this time around, so lots of things won't work in most mods any more.

We discuss the nature of obfuscated names and the problems they cause, and introduce the concepts of intermediate mappings and human-readable mappings and how they fix the problems of obfuscated mappings. We also briefly discuss how mappings are present in the development and production environments of Minecraft, and interspersed throughout the post are examples of the various mappings in play throughout the Minecraft modding community, including Mojmaps.</description></item><item><author>curle</author><title>Forgejam 2022</title><link>https://blog.minecraftforge.net/announcements/forgejam22/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jul 2022 20:46:42 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.minecraftforge.net/announcements/forgejam22/</guid><summary>The Forge Jam will run from 1st July to 31st July, with judging on the 1st August.
